# impressionism-image-generator
For this project, I have rigorously fine-tuned the stylegan architecture to generate images, of the impressionist style. With over 15k photos, and trained exhaustively with GPUs P100 and T4 alternatively. It took almost 2months of training to reach somewhat of a viable accuracy in the generation of images. If more training data was provided, and more powerful GPUs were used (provided the RAM requirements) this finetuned GAN can produce even more accurate results. 

Currently, I have trained with 46 checkpoints, the result snapshot provided is a sample produced by the GAN from the latest checkpoint

I have provided a sample of what my finetuned stylegan has produced
